            Rikers Island is one of New York City's most prominnent and infamous jails. It is also known for its extreme cases of violence and violations. Opened in 1932, Rikers has served as the main jail complex, often being the first stop for anyone arrested in New York City. With the responsibility of housing tens of thousands of inmates, has come a slew of lawsuits attacking everything from poor conditions, to lack of medical attention, to sexual assault and more.

        <p class="main-text">
            Though city officials struggle to enact large reform to Rikers, claims filed by inmates, former inmates or their families sometime result in change.

            Over decades Rikers has begun to transform and city government is addressing the concerns many New Yorkers continue to express. However, these changes have been hard won. According to the City Comptroller Scott Stringer, lawsuits filed against the city for issues on Rikers Island have cost tens of millions of dollars. In 2015, three wrongful death cases resulted in settlements of over $1 million dollars to each family of the deceased inmate.</p>
        
         <p class="main-text">

            "Rikers is a fiscal problem," said Stringer. Critiques of the de Blasio administration include his focus on reforming inmate and correctional officer relations, as compared to an overhaul of the facilities, a stance Stringer supports. Activists and Community Organizations like the Close Rikers Island initiative are often behind the big pushes for reform. "I know de Blasio has a lot on his plate," said Khaliefa Shabazz, a Harlem resident who was jailed at Rikers for over a year and later sued the city for lack of mental health and women's services. "But I think there's no fixing Rikers. Too many problems, look at all of the complaints."
